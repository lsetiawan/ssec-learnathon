# Cloud Deployment 101

In this tutorial we will be learning about cloud deployment with [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform)
by going through their tutorial found at [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/infrastructure-as-code).
This tutorial is specifically for [AWS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs), but Terraform is cloud agnostic and can be used with Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as well.

Fun fact: The original creator of Terraform, Mitchell Hashimoto is a UW CSE Alumni class of 2011!
