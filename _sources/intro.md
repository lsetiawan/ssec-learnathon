# Welcome to SSEC Fall Learnathon 2023

These set of tutorials are the various topics that will be covered for the learnathon.
The objective for the tutorials is not to re-write existing tutorials but more of pointing
everyone to resources and walking through tutorials together to get familiarity with these tools
and best practices so that we can work better as a team.

## Day 1

Xarray and Dask 101 will be covered for this day.

## Day 2

Python Software Development best practices will be covered.

## Day 3

Cloud Deployment 101 and Jupyterbook will be covered.
